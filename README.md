# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

EcoNet is an innovative app fueled by artificial intelligence that is designed to assist people in reducing their impact on the environment by offering personalized suggestions. By studying the behaviors and choices of users, EcoNet guides individuals toward adopting more eco-friendly practices for a greener lifestyle.


## Background

Sustainability is a pressing global issue, with individual actions contributing significantly to environmental impacts. Common problems include:

Excessive energy usage at home.
High waste generation and improper recycling.
Uninformed choices about eco-friendly products.
EcoNet addresses these by educating and guiding users, promoting eco-conscious behaviors. I'm motivated by the urgent need for climate action and believe small changes can make a big difference.


## How is it used?

Users input their daily activities, such as travel, shopping, and home energy use. EcoNet processes this data to:

Highlight areas with high environmental impact.
Suggest alternatives like public transport routes, energy-saving appliances, and recycling tips.
Track progress and show the impact of changes over time.
Ideal for eco-conscious individuals and families looking to improve their lifestyle.

## Data sources and AI methods
Data comes from user inputs and public databases on product emissions. Additional insights could be sourced from smart home APIs, like Google Nest or smart meters.



## Challenges

EcoNet does not solve systemic issues or replace the need for policy change. It requires user honesty and commitment. Privacy and data security are paramount, ensuring user data is used ethically and transparently.

## What next?

Future iterations could integrate with smart home devices for real-time monitoring. Partnerships with environmental organizations could enhance recommendations. Iâ€™d need data science and security expertise to advance the project.
